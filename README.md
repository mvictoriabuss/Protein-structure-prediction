# Protein Structure Prediction
Repository with all scripts and data generated for my internship at the Computational Biology department of Institut Pasteur of Paris. </p></p>

This research internship project was carried out in the Metagenomic Signatures group, led by Sean Kennedy, in the framework of the InSPIRe project (Innovative Strategies for Perinatal Infection Risk-reduction).
The understanding of the bacteria-host interactions within the vaginal microbiota is hampered by an incomplete functional annotation. </p>
The aim of my work was to apply ground-breaking protein structure prediction techniques to improve the annotation of dominant vaginal microbiota species in order to better understand their adaptations to and impact on the host vaginal microbiota. </p>
The goal was to develop a systematic pipeline that allows the functional annotation of predicted ORFs in bacterial genomes using the AlphaFold2 implementation on Institut Pasteur HPC cluster.
